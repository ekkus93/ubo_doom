# Controls

The Ubo has 7 physical buttons: UP, DOWN, L1, L2, L3, BACK, HOME.
There are no LEFT/RIGHT buttons. Turning is handled via the L2/L3 footer buttons,
and a mode toggle (L1) gives access to the full Doom control set.

## Normal mode (default)

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| UP | move forward |
| DOWN | move backward |
| L1 (A) | toggle ALT mode (footer shows "ALT") |
| L2 (B) | turn left (◄) |
| L3 (X) | turn right (►), or confirm/select when menu is open |
| BACK | in-level: fire; menu open: confirm/select; title/demo: open menu (ESC) |
| HOME | exit Doom (ubo handles; always active) |

## ALT mode (press L1 to activate; footer shows "NRM" to go back)

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| UP | move forward |
| DOWN | move backward |
| L1 (A) | toggle back to normal mode |
| L2 (B) | use (open doors / switches) |
| L3 (X) | escape / in-game menu |
| BACK | fire (always, both modes) |
| HOME | exit Doom (ubo handles; always active) |

## Notes

- ALT mode can only be toggled while actively in a level.
- ALT mode is automatically cleared when leaving a level (menu/intermission/finale/demo).
